Adds new requirement for all personal injury or wrongful death claims brought by a member or a member\\u2019s representative or estate against a third party to include a claim for all medical assistance payments for health care items or services furnished to the member as a result of the injury; deems such a claim that does not include the Plan\\u2019s claim to include the Plan\\u2019s claim. Makes the Plan\\u2019s claim a lien upon any recovery a member or a member\\u2019s representative or estate obtains. Makes clarifying changes, specifying that the Plan has the right to first recovery over all nongovernmental liens and rights on any amounts recovered related to an injury caused by a liable third party, regardless of the timing of nongovernmental liens and rights in relation to the Plan\\u2019s liens and rights, who recovered the amount or how the amount was recovered. Allows the Plan to recover amounts the Plan is entitled to from the member, the member\\u2019s representative or estate, or the insurance company (previously, just the member) in the event the member or the member\\u2019s representative or estate (previously, just the member) recovers any amount from a liable third party.

Creates a new notification requirement, requiring the members, the member\\u2019s representative or estate, or the insurance company to notify the Plan within 14 days of receipt of the proceeds of a settlement or judgment related to a claim under the statute. Further, requires the member, the member\\u2019s representative or estate, or the insurance company to distribute the sufficient amount to satisfy the Plan\\u2019s lien to the Plan within 30 days of receipt of the proceeds of a settlement or judgment.

Adds to the prohibition against a lien of the Plan exceeding 50% of the total damages recovered by the member, excluding from the calculation the member\\u2019s reasonable and proportionate costs of collection, conclusively determined by the Plan (previously, excluded the member\\u2019s reasonable costs of collection only). Adds new provisions providing for situations when governmental liens have priority over the Plan\\u2019s right to first recovery. Specifically prohibits the deduction of other liens from the Plan\\u2019s right to to recover under the statute. Adds that in the event insufficient funds remain to fully satisfy the Plan\\u2019s lien after deducting the member\\u2019s or member\\u2019s representative or estate\\u2019s costs of collection and any priority liens from the total damages recovered, the Plan is entitled to the remaining balance of the total damages recovered.\\nSection 7\\nEnacts GS 135-48.41(l), deeming the date of reemployment as the first hired date for purposes of Plan membership eligibility if an employee or retiree withdraws his or her accumulated contributions and then later is reemployed as an employee.

Makes conforming terminology changes. Describes the changes as a clarification of existing law, and provides that no subscriber or communications service provider is liable to any person or entity for billing or remitting a different number of 911 service charged than that required by the Part for any services for which a bill is or has been rendered prior to 180 days following the date the act becomes law. Requires service charges imposed to ensure full cost recovery for communications service providers over a reasonable period of time, for monthly distributions to primary PSAPs, and for the State ESInet (previously referred to rates rather than charges imposed and required full cost recovery for communications service providers and for primary PSAPs over a reasonable period of time; did not include cost recovery for the State ESInet). Make conforming changes.\\nAmends GS 143B-1404 to increase from 2% to 3.5% the amount of the total service charges remitted to the Board under GS 143B-1403 the Board may retain for its administrative expenses. Now requires the Board to allocate 15% rather than 10% of the total service charges to the Next Generation 911 Reserve Fund, and 5% of the total service charges to the PSAP Grant and Statewide Projects Account. Requires the remaining revenues to be allocated for distribution to the primary PSAPs, CMRS providers, or the Accounts establishes in GS 143B-1407 (the PSAP Grant and Statewide Projects Account and the Next Generation 911 Reserve Fund). Makes technical and conforming changes. Makes further conforming changes throughout the remainder of the Part to refer to the Accounts rather than the PSAP Grant and Statewide Projects Account alone.\\nAmends GS 143B-1405 to require a CMRS provider to request reimbursement from the 911 Fund by presenting a request to the Board within six months prior to the end of the Board's fiscal year and identifying the provider's anticipated qualified expenses for reimbursement during the Board's next fiscal year. Eliminates the provision regarding accrual of interest on deferred payments. Provides for reallocation of excess funds to the Accounts established under GS 143B-1407 if reimbursement amounts to CMRS providers budgeted by the Board for a fiscal year exceed the amount of funds disbursed. Removes the requirement that the Board consider reduction of the service charge if reallocation totals more than $3 million in a calendar year. Makes further technical and conforming changes.\\u00a0\\nMakes conforming changes to GS 143B-1406 regarding monthly distribution from the 911 Fund to primary PSAPs. Concerning the funding formula, requires the Board to consider any interlocal government funding agreement to operate a regional PSAP (previously did not specify the nature of the interlocal agreement) among other specified considerations in existing law. Specifies that if the Board does not designate an amount to be allocated to the Accounts established under GS 143B-1407, the Board must distribute all remaining funds to regional or primary PSAPs on a per capita basis (previously did not specify which PSAPs). Conditions eligibility to carryforward distributions on compliance with the requirements of subsection (f) of the statute, as modified. Adds that amounts carried forward to the next fiscal year from distributions made by the Board cannot be used to lower distributions unless the monthly distribution amount in subsection (a) is modified based upon the Board's expenditures for Statewide 911 projects or the PSAP's migration to a next generation 911 network (in addition to the exception provided in existing law for when the monthly distribution amount is greater than 20% of the average yearly amount distributed to the PSAP in the prior two years). Modifies the authorized use of distributions to include the lease, purchase, or maintenance of emergency medical, fire, and law enforcement pre-arrival instruction software. Prohibits use of the funds for addressing or service supplier 911 service and other recurring charges supplanted by the State ESInet costs paid by the Board, following the earlier of July 1, 2021, or compliance with new subsection (e1), which mandates implementation of plans to migrate PSAPs to the State ESInet by July 1, 2021. No longer authorizes the use of funds to pay for nonrecurring costs of establishing a 911 system. New subsection (e1) details parameters for the migration of PSAPs to the State ESInet on a regional basis and provides for extension of the deadline for good cause. Details requirements of all communication service providers and State ESInet service providers regarding points of interconnection for routing and delivering 911 calls. Modifies and adds to the compliance provisions set forth in subsection (f) on which the monthly distribution is conditioned. Now requires each PSAP dispatching emergency medical services to develop policies and procedures for implementing an approved Emergency Medical Dispatch program, as specified, by July 1, 2019. Further requires each PSAP to deploy equipment, products, and services necessary or appropriate for receipt and processing of calls for emergency assistance sent by text messages consistent with the specified FCC Order(s). Mandates that every local government participate in a 911 system. Requires that the establishment and operation of Regional PSAPs be a coordinated effort among local governments and the Board. Clarifies that Article 15 does not prohibit or discourage the formation of Regional PSAPs. Additionally, establishes a forty-hour training course requirement for telecommunicators within their first year of employment for persons beginning employment after July 1, 2019, as specified, and establishes a requirement of completion of a medical dispatch course or emergency medical dispatch course for all telecommunicators by July 1, 2020, or within six months of the date of employment if employed after that date.\\u00a0\\nAmends GS 143B-1407 to require that eligible projects for use of funds from the Accounts be an eligible expense under GS 143B-1406(d) (as amended concerning authorized uses) rather than GS 143B-1406(e) (local funds). Additioanlly, authorizes the Board to provide funds from the Next Generation 911 Fund directly to primary PSAPs (previously did not limit the authority to primary PSAPs) to implement next generation 911 systems.\\nMakes technical changes to GS 143B-1408 concerning recovery of unauthorized use of funds, to require monies received under the Part rather than the statute to be credited to the 911 Fund.\\u00a0\\nMakes clarifying and conforming changes to GS 143B-1409 (Conditions for providing enhanced 911 service).\\nExpands GS 143B-1413 regarding immunity for service and system providers and their employees, directors, officers, vendors, and agents to acts and omissions concerning text-to-911 service.

Sets out six purposes and objectives of the Psychology Interjurisdictional Licensure Compact (Compact), including increasing public access to professional psychological services by allowing telepsychological practice across state lines and temporary in-person, face-to-face services into a state in which the psychologist is not licensed to practice and enhancing the states\\u2019 ability to protect public health and safety. Defines terms that are used in the Article, including\\u00a0telepsychology, which is defined as the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies.\\nSpecifies that the home state is a compact state where a psychologist is licensed to practice psychology. Allows a psychologist to hold one or more compact state licenses at a time and allows a compact state to require a psychologist not previously licensed in a compact state to obtain and retain a license to practice in the compact state under circumstances not allowed by the Authority to Practice Interjurisdictional Telepsychology under the terms of the Compact. Also allows a compact state to require a psychologist to obtain and retain a license to be authorized to practice in a compact state under circumstances not authorized by Temporary Authorization to Practice under the Compact terms. Temporary Authorization to Practice is a licensed psychologist\\u2019s authority to conduct temporary in-person, face-to-face practice, within the limits authorized under the Compact, in another compact state. Temporary in-person, face-to-face practice is where a psychologist is physically present (not through the use of telecommunications technologies), in the distant state to provide for the practice of psychology for 30 days within a calendar year and based on notification to the distant state. Sets out five conditions that must be met in order for a home state\\u2019s license to authorize a psychologist to practice in a\\u00a0receiving state\\u00a0(defined as a compact state where the client/patient is physically located when the telepsychological services are delivered), including that the compact state has a mechanism in place for receiving and investigating complaints about licensed individuals and the compact state complies with the bylaws and rules of the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact Commission (Commission).

Provides that the home state maintains authority over the license of any psychologist practicing into a receiving state and makes a psychologist practicing into a receiving state subject to the receiving state\\u2019s scope of practice. Prohibits a psychologist from practicing telepsychology in a compact state if the psychologist\\u2019s license is restricted, suspended, or otherwise limited.\\nEstablishes requirements that psychologists licensed to practice in a Compact State must meet in order to exercise the Temporary Authorization to Practice, including holding a graduate degree in psychology that meets specified criteria; possessing a current, full, and unrestricted license to practice in a home state that is also a compact state; and having no criminal record history that violates Commission rules. Requires a psychologist practicing into a distant state under the Temporary Authorization to Practice to practice within the scope of practice authorized by the distant state; psychologists practicing into a distant state are subject to the distant state\\u2019s authority and law. Prohibits a psychologist from practicing telepsychology in a compact state if the psychologist\\u2019s license is restricted, suspended, or otherwise limited.\\nAllows a psychologist to practice in a receiving state only in the performance of the scope of practice for psychology as assigned by the appropriate state psychology regulatory authority and under the following circumstances: (1) the psychologist initiates a client/patient contact in a home state via telecommunications technologies with a client/patient in a Receiving State or (2) other conditions regarding telepsychology as determined by Commission rules.\\nSets out conditions under which a home state or receiving state may take adverse action against a psychologist and the procedures that are to be followed.\\nSets out additional authority granted to a compact state\\u2019s psychology regulatory authority, including issuing cease and desist and/or injunctive relief orders to revoke a psychologist\\u2019s Authority to Practice Interjurisdictional Telepsychology and/or Temporary Authorization to Practice.\\nRequires the Commission to develop and maintain a coordinated licensure information system (coordinated database) and reporting system that contains licensure and disciplinary action information on all psychologists to whom the Compact is applicable. Sets out information that compact state must provide to the coordinated database. Sets out additional procedures for not sharing designated information and expunging information in the coordinated database.\\nProvides for the creation of a joint public agency by the compact states to be known as the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact Commission (Commission). Sets out requirements for Commission membership, voting, and meetings, which are to occur at least once during each calendar year. Requires the Commission to prescribe bylaws and/or rules to govern its conduct. Establishes the Commission\\u2019s 14 powers, including bringing and prosecuting legal proceedings or actions in the name of the Commission; borrowing, accepting, or contracting for services of personnel; disposing of any property; and establishing a budget and making expenditures. Sets out requirements for the Executive Board, made up of six elected officers. Sets out provisions governing the financing of the Commission. Provides for qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification of Commission members, officers, executive director, employees and representatives.\\nEstablishes criteria that must be met and procedures that must be followed when the Commission exercises its rule-making powers. Provides that if a majority of the legislatures of the compact states reject a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then the rule has no further force and effect in any compact state. Includes situations when public hearing requirements must be met before a rule or amendment is adopted. Sets out conditions for adoption of emergency rules.\\nRequires the executive, legislative, and judicial branches in each compact state to enforce the Compact and gives the Compact\\u2019s provisions and rules standing as statutory law.

GS 7B-906.1(d)(3) concerns a court determining whether efforts to reunite the juvenile with either parent clearly would be unsuccessful or inconsistent with the juvenile's health or safety and need for a safe, permanent home within a reasonable period of time.

Requires the court to make a finding about whether the reunification efforts to the county department of social services were reasonable at each permanency planning hearing (was, at the first permanency planning hearing) unless reunification efforts were previously ceased. Requires the court to make specified written findings at any permanency planning hearing demonstrating the degree of success or failure toward reunification (was, the lack of success).\\nAmends GS 7B-908, concerning placement review post-termination of parental rights.

Modifies the term eligible recipient to no longer specifically require partnerships to be formed on or after January 1, 2018. Amends the definition of infrastructure costs to no longer specifically include equipment, fiber, and construction. Adds to the defined terms infrastructure, partnership, and prospective broadband recipient. Defines partnership to mean a project for which an Internet service provider affirms that a formalized agreement exists between the provider and one or more unaffiliated partners where the partner is either: (1) a separate Internet service provider or (2) a nonprofit or not-for-profit, or a for-profit subsidiary of either, and the Internet service provider is being allowed access and use of the partner's infrastructure, on special terms and conditions designed to facilitate the provision of broadband services in unserved areas, or is utilizing a financial contribution provided by one or more partners where the total contribution is not less than 10%, but not more than 49%, of the match required by the statute. Adds that a county that is not engaged in providing consumer broadband service may qualify as a nonprofit for the purpose of the statute.\\nModifies program eligibility. Now deems ineligible project areas comprised of census blocks, or portions of census blocks, within which a broadband provider is receiving matching funds to deploy broadband services within the next 18 months (previously, specified receipt of State or federal matching funds to deploy technologically neutral scalable broadband service within that time period). Permits a private provider receiving Universal Service or Connect America Phase II, or nonfederal funds (previously, State or federal matching) to deploy broadband service to qualify for protection by submitting within 60 days of the application period a listing of the census blocks or portions of census blocks comprising the federally funded project areas meeting the requirement and nothing more to the Broadband Infrastructure Office (Office) in the Department of Information Technology (DIT). Requires the cutoff date for submitting census block data to be established by the office, but requires the date be no less than 60 days prior to the beginning date of the application period (previously, set the cutoff date on May 15). Adds that upon the expiration of the 18-month reservation period, a private provider that has received a reservation of census blocks must submit written documentation by April 30 of the year following the program year that broadband development has begun or been completed in the census blocks or portions of the census blocks deemed ineligible by the Office due to the existence of a federally funded project area.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nAdds to the information that grant applications must include to now require available addresses or other identifying information satisfactory to the Office relating to the area to be served, as specified. Authorizes the Office to require an applicant to submit additional information in the event the Office is unable to identify the proposed project area with specificity. Also requires applications to, in the event construction of the proposed project would result in the provision of broadband services to areas that are not eligible for funding, identify the ineligible areas.\\nEstablishes that a provider submitting an application bears the burden of proof that the proposed area to be served can be served using the proposed technology. Provides that the burden of proof can be satisfied by the submission of data, maps, and any other information satisfactory to the Office that demonstrates that the area and number of prospective broadband recipients proposed to be served can be provided the minimum upload and download speeds indicated in the application.\\nProvides for applications to be amended to accurately reflect the level of current broadband service, and allows the Office to revise application scores based on the amended application. Concerning provider protest to an application, allows the Office to release to an applicant the locations or areas declared ineligible following a protest granted for a portion of the application. Deems this information not public record and confidential. Adds a new requirement for any provider submitting a protest to verify the accuracy of the protest and that the protest is submitted in good faith. Authorizes the Office to deny any protest or application that contains inaccurate information, and to use speed tests to resolve a protest, as provided.\\u00a0\\nAmends the scoring of project applications. Concerning points for projects involving a partnership, as defined, increases the points given for projects involving a partnership, including a county in certain instances, as specified. Concerning the points given to projects located in counties that will serve certain estimated numbers of unserved households, reduces the thresholds set forth with coordinating point values. Concerning points given to projects that will serve certain thresholds of unserved households within the eligible economically distressed county the project will serve, now provides for points based on the percentage of unserved households within the project area with coordinating point values. Additionally, modifies the base speed score multiplier schedule.\\nProvides for priority of applications proposing to serve the highest number of new households at the lowest cost per household in the event there is a tie for applications receiving the same score.\\nAdds a new requirement for grant recipients to certify and provide to the Office evidence consistent with FCC attestation that either speeds greater than those identified in the application guidelines or the proposed upstream and downstream broadband speeds identified in the application guidelines are available throughout the project area prior to any end user connections (previously, require attestation that the proposed minimum upstream and downstream broadband speeds identified in the application guidelines are available throughout the project area as specified).\\u00a0\\nModifies the grant recipient matching requirements that are based on the application score. Prohibits Connect America Phase II Fund from being used for the required matching funds, in addition to Universal Service Fund (previously, Connect America Fund was prohibited, as well as other grants awarded for broadband expansion through a separate State or federal program). Permits any current or future federal funds to be used for the required matching funds within the parameters of the program, including any future phase of the Connect America Fund.\\nSections 2 and 3\\nAmends GS 143B-1373, as amended, to include a county designated as a development tier two area in the definition of eligible economically distressed county under the program (was, limited to counties designated as development tier one areas). Restricts use of program funds for projects located in development tier two counties to no more than one-third of the funds appropriated to the GREAT fund. Effective July 1, 2020.\\nSection 4\\nAmends GS 143B-1373, as amended, to allow the use of program funds for projects located in development tier two counties to no more than one-half (was, one-third) of the funds appropriated to the GREAT fund, and allows the Office to allocate more if not enough grant applications for projects located in development tier one counties have been received to distribute one-half of the funds appropriated to the GREAT fund as of March 1. Effective July 1, 2021.\\nSection 5\\nEnacts GS 143B-1373(p) to authorize DIT to use up to 1% of the appropriated funds to administer the program.\\nSection 6\\nDirects the Department of Administration (DOA) to collaborate with the Office to develop a streamlined approval process for the negotiation and execution of lease agreements for collocation, installation, and operation of broadband equipment on State-owned property. Requires involvement of identified stakeholders. Requires the Office to develop a streamlined approval process of no more than 270 days from the date the formal lease proposal is submitted to a State agency.

Provides legislative findings. Provides broad civil and criminal immunity for a \\\"qualified patient\\\" or a \\\"designated caregiver\\\" for purchasing or possessing cannabis for medical use if the quantity does not exceed an \\\"adequate supply\\\" for the patient as determined by his or her physician. Adequate supply is defined by the act to, among other things, (1) apply only to cannabis from an intrastate source and (2) limit permitted supply to an amount needed for a three-month period and not more than 24 ounces. Requires the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to issue \\\"registry identification cards\\\" to persons who qualify as qualified patients or designated caregivers, and provides that a card creates a rebuttable presumption of permissible use if the person does not possess more than an adequate supply. Specifies conditions under which provisions of the act are applicable to minors. Prohibits a school, employer, or landlord from refusing to enroll, employ, or lease to, or to otherwise penalize, a person because of his or her status under the act or the permissible possession or use of cannabis. Also provides immunity and protection from penalties for licensed producers of medical cannabis and for physicians for conduct consistent with the act. Provides other protections relating to conduct of law enforcement, child custody or visitation, constructive possession, and the unauthorized substances tax.\\nThe act does not permit a person to control a motor vehicle, aircraft, or motorboat while impaired by cannabis; undertake any task under the influence of cannabis that would constitute negligence or malpractice; or smoke cannabis in a school bus or on public transportation, on school grounds, in a correctional facility, or in any public place in the state. No government-sponsored medical assistance program or private health insurer is required by the act to cover costs of medical use of cannabis, and an employer is not required to accommodate use in the workplace. Makes fraudulent representation to law enforcement of any fact relating to medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest or prosecution a Class 2 misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 and any other applicable penalty. Specifies criteria and procedures for DHHS issuance or renewal of registry identification cards and requires that DHHS maintain a confidential list of persons to whom cards are issued. Allows DHHS to verify for law enforcement whether a card is valid and to report to law enforcement about falsified or fraudulent information submitted to DHHS. Makes violation of the confidentiality provision a Class 1 misdemeanor, subject to a fine of up to $1,000.\\nDirects the NC Medical Care Commission to adopt rules to implement the provisions regarding registry cards, establishing requirements for the issuance of registry identification cards to qualified patients and designated caregivers who meet certain minimum specifications. Requires the rules be adopted no later than 120 days after the effective date of the act.\\nDirects the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to establish a medical cannabis supply system to provide a safe, regulated supply of cannabis appropriate for medical use by qualified patients with a valid registry identification card and to generate revenue sufficient to maintain and operate the system. Prohibits use of appropriations from the General Fund to establish or operate the system, which must be funded by authorized fees. Establishes criteria for licensing of medical cannabis supply centers (for the sale of cannabis, cannabis-infused products, and related paraphernalia to qualified patients and caregivers holding a valid registry identification card), producers of medical cannabis, and producers of cannabis-infused products, as well as for suspending or revoking licenses. Requires the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to maintain a confidential list of licensees and specifies when it may release information to law enforcement. Requires the Board of Agriculture, in consultation with the Medical Care Commission, to adopt rules to implement the supply system, and provides for temporary rules in the interim. Specifies when medical use of cannabis may be asserted by qualified patients and caregivers as an affirmative defense to a criminal charge. Expresses the General Assembly's intent that the University of North Carolina system undertake scientific research regarding the efficacy and safety of the medical use of cannabis and, subject to approval by the UNC Board of Governors, directs the university to create the North Carolina Cannabis Research Program. Provides a severability clause.

Preserves the option of cities and counties to adopt regulations under either this Chapter (development regulations), Article 8 of Chapter 160A, or Article 6 of Chapter 153A (general police power), but specifies that the substantive limitations imposed by this Article apply regardless of the source of authority being used by the local government.\\nGS 160D-9-3 clarifies that county zoning exemptions for bona fide farming apply to city zoning within a city\\u2019s extraterritorial jurisdiction, providing the same zoning and other development regulation treatment for farm land in a municipal extraterritorial jurisdiction as would be provided if the property were in county jurisdiction. Replaces a reference to compliance with a specific federal regulation on floodplain regulation with compliance with state or federal law generally. \\u00a0Amends a provision to authorize municipalities to exempt accessory buildings of \\u201cbona fide farms\\u201d from the building code as they would have been exempted under county zoning (currently, only authorizes listed municipalities in Wake County).

Limits the proposed exception to now provide that instead of purchasing or leasing any special tools that are required by a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, a franchised dealer that sells fewer than 350 new motor vehicles per year may request approval from the manufacturer to enter into a local tool loaner agreement with another dealer if eight conditions are met (previously allowed dealers to share\\u00a0access to special tools with other dealers if four specified conditions are met, wholly distinct from the new conditions). Among the conditions that must be satisfied for a local tool loaner agreement are requirements that all participating dealers be located within a 40-mile radius of the dealer responsible for purchasing the specified special tools, the agreement be capped at five participating dealers, and the agreement be approved by the manufacturer, including the list of participating dealers and eligible special tools.\\u00a0\\nAdds to the proposed changes to GS 20-305 which (1) allow franchised new motor vehicle dealers who believe that it is unreasonable for a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch with whom the dealer has entered into a franchise to include one or more portions of the dealer's existing area of responsibility previously assigned to that dealer to request the elimination of the contested territory from the dealer's area of responsibility by submitting a written request and (2) allow a dealer to file a petition within 60 days of receiving notice of the manufacturer's rejection of the dealer's request to eliminate the contested territory. Now qualifies the rights of new motor vehicle dealers under the subdivision on the dealer having not previously filed a petition under the subdivision within the preceding 48 months regarding the dealer's currently assigned areas of responsibility. Deems the dealer's request accepted if notice of objection of the request is not sent within 60 days of request (was, within 30 days). Specifies that in an evidentiary hearing of a dealer's petition contesting the proposed assignment or changes of the dealer's area of responsibility by a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, the burden of proof is on the affected manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch. Establishes that in an evidentiary hearing for a dealer's petition to eliminate contested territory from the dealer's existing area of responsibility previously assigned to the dealer by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, the burden of proof is on the dealer to prove that the continued inclusion of the contested territory in the dealer's area of responsibility is unreasonable under the circumstances or has been assigned arbitrarily in light of the present or projected future pattern of motor vehicle sales and registrations within the franchised dealer's new motor vehicle dealer's market.\\nEliminates the proposed changes to GS 20-305(51) (provisions which make it unlawful to establish, implement, or enforce criteria for measuring the sales or service performance of certain of its franchised new motor vehicle dealers in this state and instead maintains existing statutory language).\\nModifies proposed GS 20-305(52) to now make it illegal to prohibit or unreasonably limit or restrict a dealer from offering for sale over the Internet (previously, to prohibit, limit, or restrict a dealer from selling over the Internet) parts and accessories obtained by the dealer from the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, or from any source recommended or approved by such entities. Specifies that the new subdivision does not eliminate or impair the intellectual property rights of a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch.\\nAdds to the proposed changes to GS 20-305.1 (concerning automobile dealer warranty and recall obligations) to exclude audits conducted for cause from the proposed limitation of one audit per 12-month period for (1) warranty or recall parts or service compensation, or compensation for a qualifying used motor vehicle, and (2) for sales incentives, service incentives, rebates, or other forms in incentive compensation. Defines\\u00a0audit conducted for cause to mean an audit based on either statistical evidence that the dealer's claims are unreasonably high or that the dealer's claims submissions violate reasonable claims documentation or other applicable requirements of the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch. Requires the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch which elects to perform an audit conducted for cause to explain in detail in the audit notice the data or other foundation upon which the cause is based. Similarly, provides that the statute does not prohibit or limit a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch from conducting an audit of sales or leases made by one of its franchised dealers with known exporters or brokers for cause at any time during the permitted time period. Specifies that these provisions apply to audits of a dealer by a manufacturer for sales or leases made to known exporters or brokers. Defines for cause under this provision to mean the dealer's sale or lease of motor vehicles to individuals identified on a list of known motor vehicle exporters or brokers previously provided by or posted on a website made accessible to the dealer by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch.\\nAdds to the proposed changes to GS 20-305.7, establishing that the dealer's data contained in or on a dealer management computer system owned or leased by a dealer located in the state is the sole and exclusive property of the dealer. Defines\\u00a0dealer data\\u00a0and\\u00a0dealer's data\\u00a0to mean information or other data that has been entered or stored on the dealer's dealer management computer system by an officer, employee, or contractee of the dealer, whether stored or hosted on-site at a dealer location or on the cloud, or at any other remote location, that relates to one of the 13 subjects; excludes proprietary software of the dealer management computer system provider. Further modifies one of the three conditions that must be met in order to avoid voiding the requirement to include that the dealer is either permitted to restrict the data fields that may be accessed in the dealers's dealer management computer system (was, dealer's computer system), or the dealer is allowed to provide the same data or information by furnishing the data in a widely accepted file format. Now makes it unlawful for any manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch to fail or refuse to a provide dealer notice, in a standalone written document, at least 45 days (was, at least 60 days) before making any changes in any of the dealer or customer data the dealer is required to share. Makes clarifying changes.\\nConsolidates and modifies the prohibitions established in proposed GS 20-305.7(b1) (applicable to any manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, dealer management computer system vendor, or any third party with access to a dealer management computer system)\\u00a0and (b2) (applicable to any dealer management computer system vendor or other third party who has access to any dealer management computer system). Now, makes it unlawful for any dealer management computer system vendor or any third party with access to a dealer management computer system to (1) take any action that would prohibit or limit a dealer's ability to protect, store, copy, share, or use any customer or dealer information maintained in a dealer management computer system used by a new motor vehicle dealer located in the state; (2) access, use, store, or share any dealer data from a dealer management computer system in any manner other than by express written agreement; (3) fail to provide the dealer with the option and ability to securely obtain and push dealer data to third parties; (4) fail to promptly provide a dealer a written listing of all entities with whom the dealer's data is shared currently and over the preceding three years upon request; (5) fail to allow a dealer the ability to verify the data from the dealer's dealer management computer system provided or shared with third parties; (6) fail to allow and facilitate a dealer to audit the dealer management computer system and any specific data fields and data obtained or obtainable from its system; and (7) fail to promptly facilitate the transfer of the dealer's data maintained on its dealer management computer system to another system vendor in a secure, usable manner upon the dealer's written request any contract or agreement regarding the hardware or software related to the dealer's dealer management computer system, or hold the dealer responsible for fees in excess of reasonable charges incurred in the transfer. Specifies that service providers are permitted to recoup development costs incurred to provide the services involved and to make a reasonable profit on the service provided concerning transfers and access to information.\\nFurther amends GS 20-308.1 concerning when a cognizable injury to the collective interest of the members of the motor vehicle or motorcycle association is deemed to have occurred when a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch doing business in this state engages in any conduct or takes action that has harmed or would harm or which has or would affect either (1) the majority of its franchised new motor vehicle dealers in the state or (2) a majority of all franchised new motor vehicle dealers in the state (previously provided for the affect of all or a substantial number of franchised new motor vehicle dealers in the state). Establishes that a court's declaratory ruling on the Article's applicability to or interpretation of the rights and obligations of one or more manufacturers or dealers is collateral estoppel in any subsequent civil action or administrative proceeding involving the same manufacturer(s) or the same dealer(s) on all issues of fact and law decided in the original civil action in which the association was a party.\\u00a0\\n \\n Business and Commerce, Courts/Judiciary, Motor Vehicle \\n GS 20 \\n  \\n\\n Bill H 455 (2019-2020) \\n Summary date: Mar 26 2019 - View summary \\n Amends the definitions in GS 20-286 that apply to the motor vehicle dealers and manufacturers licensing laws by adding and defining the term special tool or essential tool.\\nAmends GS 20-305 to make unlawful for any manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, or any field representative, officer, agent, or any representative whatsoever of any of them, to require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in the state to purchase or lease computer hardware or software used for any purpose other than the maintenance or repair of motor vehicles (was, to purchase nondiagnostic computer equipment or programs). Adds that instead of purchasing or leasing any special tools that are required by a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, a dealer may share access to special tools with other dealers if the four specified conditions are met, including that the dealers have franchises with the same manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, and that sharing tools will not unreasonably delay the completion of repairs. Further amends the statute by amending the definition of goods as used in the prohibition of\\u00a0requiring, coercing, or attempting to coerce a dealer located in this state to purchase goods or services of any nature from a vendor selected, identified, or designated by a manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source when the dealer may obtain goods or services of substantially similar quality and design from a vendor selected by the dealer, provided the dealer obtains prior approval from the manufacturer, distributor, affiliate, or captive finance source, for the use of the dealer's selected vendor. Provides that \\\"goods\\\" does not include parts as reasonably required by the manufacturer to be used in repairs under warranty obligations of a manufacturer or distributor.\\u00a0\\nAmends the provisions of GS 20-305 that make it illegal to assign or change a franchised new motor vehicle dealer's area of responsibility under the franchise arbitrarily or without due regard to the present or projected future pattern of motor vehicle sales and registrations within the dealer's market and without having provided the affected dealer with written notice, as specified. Adds that a franchised new motor vehicle dealer who believes that it is unreasonable for a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch with whom the dealer has entered into a franchise to include one or more portions of the dealer's existing area of responsibility previously unassigned to that dealer may request the elimination of the contested territory from the dealer's area of responsibility by submitting a written request.

Now authorizes the court to appoint or reappoint a parenting coordinator at any time in a child custody action involving minor children brought under Article 1, on or after entry of a custody order other than an ex parte order, or upon entry of a contempt order involving a custody issue pursuant to: (1) all parties' consent to the appointment and the scope of authority; (2) upon motion of a party requesting the appointment; or (3) upon the court's own motion (previously, did not provide for reappointment; specified during the proceedings of the action; did not provide for the court to make appointment upon motion of a party requesting appointment or upon its own motion). Further provides for the court to make specified findings that the action is a high-conflict case, the appointment is in the best interests of any minor child in the case, and that the parties are able to pay for the cost of the coordinator, in the event the parties have not consented to the appointment (previously, allowed the court to make the appointment without consent of the parties upon entry of a custody order other than an ex parte order, or upon entry of a parenting plan, only if those specified findings were made). Adds that the court does not have to find a substantial change of circumstance has occurred to appoint a parenting coordinator. Requires the appointing order to specify the terms of the appointment. Removes the requirements for the order to specifically incorporate any agreement regarding the role of the coordinator made by the parties. Also eliminates the requirement for the court to give a copy of the order to the parties prior to the appointment conference. Provides for selection of the parenting coordinator from a list maintained by the district court (previously, selection specifically by the court). Clarifies that prior to appointment, the court, the parties' attorneys, or the parties must contact the coordinator to determine if the coordinator is willing and able to accept the appointment.\\nAmends GS 50-92, regarding the authority of the parenting coordinator. Requires the authority to be limited to matters that will aid the parties in complying with the custody order, resolving disputes regarding issues that were not specifically addressed in the custody order, or ambiguous or conflicting terms in the custody order (previously, identify disputed issues, reduce misunderstandings, clarify priorities, explore possibilities for compromise, develop methods of collaboration in parenting, and compliance with the court's order). Now provides 20 areas that the scope of authority can include, but is not limited to, including transition time, pick up, or delivery; sharing vacations and holidays; diet, clothing, extracurricular activities, and discipline. Authorizes the coordinator to decide any issue within the scope of authority, and deems the decision enforceable as an order of the court. Requires decisions to be in writing and provided to the parties and their attorneys. Deems the decision binding so long as the custody order is in effect, even after the expiration of the coordinator's term unless the coordinator or subsequent coordinator modifies the decision or the courts review and modify the decision. Allows any party or their attorney to file a motion for the court to review a coordinator's decision. Requires the parties to comply with the decision unless the court, after a review hearing, determines the decision is not in the child's best interest or the decision exceeded the scope of authority (previously, allowed the court to authorize the coordinator to make decisions regarding implementation of the parenting plan not specifically governed by the order, binding on the parties until reviewed by the court at a hearing at the request of the coordinator or either party; did not provide specific findings the court must make in its review of the decision). Provides that the moving party or their attorney must cause a subpoena to be issued for the coordinator's attendance at the review hearing (previously, only the judge presiding over the case could subpoena the coordinator to attend and testify at the review hearing). Requires the court to determine how the coordinator's fees are to be apportioned between the parties at the conclusion of the review hearing. Further authorizes the court to review and modify the coordinator's decision after the expiration of a parenting coordinator's term (not previously provided for). Requires the coordinator to provide any financial issues related to the coordinator's decisions to the parties or their attorneys (previously, did not specify that financial issues must relate to the coordinator's decisions and limited reference to the parties' attorneys). Make further clarifying changes.\\nAmends GS 50-93, regarding qualifications for inclusion of the district court's list of parenting coordinators, now requiring the person to hold a master's or doctorate degree in psychology, law, social work, or counseling (removing the qualification to hold a master's degree or doctorate degree in medicine or a related area) and current North Carolina license in the coordinator's areas of practice (previously, did not specify the license must be a North Carolina license; removes the qualifying phrase of applicability).\\u00a0\\nAmends GS 50-94, concerning the parenting coordinator appointment conference, to no longer require a conference if the coordinator's term is later extended; a subsequent coordinator is appointed in the same matter; or the parties, their attorneys, and the proposed coordinator consent to a waiver of the conference by signing the proposed appointment order. Prohibits the court from entering an appointment order or conducting a conference unless a custody order has already been entered or is simultaneously entered. Removes the requirement for the court to determine the information each party must provide to the parenting coordinator at the time of the appointment conference. Makes clarifying changes. Eliminates the provisions requiring the coordinator and any guardians ad litem to bring all necessary releases, contracts, and consents to the conference, and requiring the coordinator to schedule the first session with the parties.\\nAmends GS 50-95, concerning fees of the parenting coordinator, to now require the coordinator to file a fee report and request a hearing in the event of a dispute of fee or retainer payment (previously, the coordinator was not required to file a fee report, and disputes on retainers were not included). Now additionally provides for a party disputing the fees or the allocation of the fees to file a motion with the court requesting a review of the fees. Adds that the district court retains jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding the coordinator's fees after the conclusion of the coordinator's term so long as the coordinator's fee report was filed in a timely manner. Removes the provision authorizing the court to condition the appointment upon the parties' payment of a specified fee to the coordinator, and prohibiting the coordinator from beginning any duties until the fee has been paid.\\nExpands GS 50-96, now allowing meeting and communications between the parties, their attorneys, or any other person with information that assists the coordinator in the coordinator's duties, to be informal and ex parte. Now requires the parties to timely execute any releases necessary to facilitate communication with any person having information that assists the coordinator in the coordinator's duties, upon request of the coordinator. Authorizes the coordinator, in the coordinator's discretion, to meet or communicate with the minor children.\\u00a0\\nRewrites GS 50-97, regarding reports of the parenting coordinator. Now permits the coordinator to file a report with the court regarding any of the five specified issues, including the parenting coordinator's belief that the existing custody order is not in the best interest of the child, a party's noncompliance with a decision of the coordinator or the terms of the custody order, or the parenting coordinator's request that the appointment be modified or terminated. Provides for a hearing in the event of a party's noncompliance with the coordinator's decision, the terms of the custody order, or nonpayment of the coordinator fees (previously, provided for a hearing no later than two weeks following receipt of the required report if the coordinator made noncompliance determinations). Specifies that the provisions do not prevent a party from filing its own motion regarding noncompliance with the coordinator's decision or the terms of the custody order. Now requires an expedited hearing to be granted and occur within four weeks of the filing of the report unless the coordinator requests longer or the court has already issued an order directing a party to show cause why the party should not be held in contempt. Authorizes the court to issue temporary custody orders as required for a child's best interest after a hearing on the report.\\u00a0\\nRewrites GS 50-98, regarding parenting coordinator records, to permit the coordinator to release any records held by the coordinator to the parties or their attorneys, at the discretion of the coordinator (previously, required the coordinator to provide written summaries of development and copies of other written communications to the parties and their attorneys; also required coordinators to maintain records of each meeting, which could only be subpoenaed by the presiding judge, and were reviewable in camera and released only if the court determined the records would assist the parties with the presentation of their case at trial). Now permits any party to apply to the presiding judge for the issuance of a subpoena to compel production of the coordinator's records. Requires any party submitting the application to provide reasonable notice to the coordinator and the parties so that any objection to the release of information or the manner of release can be considered prior to the issuance of the subpoena.\\u00a0\\nAmends GS 50-99, authorizing the court to terminate or modify the parenting coordinator's appointment upon motion of any party, upon the agreement of the parties, or by the court on its own motion, for good cause shown (previously, included upon motion of either party at the request of the coordinator).

Expands the jurisdiction of state courts under the Chapter to matters in which another state is exercising jurisdiction in substantial conformity with the UCCJEA and places custody of the adoptee in an agency, the petitioner, or another custodian expressly in support of an adoption plan that does not identify a specific prospective adoptive parent other than the petitioner.

Enacts GS 7B-3807 to provide for such judicial proceedings under the Compact. Provides for initiation of the review by motion in a pending action, as specified, or by petition. Requires the administrator to communicate an intention to refuse to forward a request for approval of a placement to the receiving state or to find that a placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child, or for the matter to have been before the administrator for more than five business days, before a motion or petition is to be filed.

Maintains existing language concerning the determination calculation. Requires the award to include costs of living adjustments and similar enhancements to the participant's benefit. Provides that if a court makes the award payable as a prorated portion of the benefits made to the designated recipient, as specified in subdivisions (a)(3) or (b)(3) as amended, and divides the marital portion of the benefit equally, the court is not required to determine the total value of marital benefits before classifying and distributing the benefits; however, neither party is prohibited from presenting evidence of the total value of any marital benefits or any benefits that are separate property of either spouse. Provides for a similar distribution where a pension, retirement, or deferred compensation plan, program, system, or fund, or applicable statute, limits or restricts the amount of the benefit subject to equitable distribution.\\nRequires the court to determine the award when the amount of the benefit payable by the plan, program, system, or fund is based on contributions and held in one or more accounts with readily determinable balances, by determining the amount in the account balance that is due to contributions made or earned during the marriage and before separation, together with the income, gains, losses, appreciation, and depreciation accrued on those contributions. Allows the court to determine the award based on the proportion of the time the marriage existed simultaneously with the employment which earned the benefit subject to equitable distribution to the total amount of time of employment, as in subsection (d) as amended, if sufficient evidence is not presented to the court to make the determination required.

Now authorizes the court to appoint or reappoint a parenting coordinator at any time in a child custody action involving minor children brought under Article 1, on or after entry of a custody order other than an ex parte order, or upon entry of a contempt order involving a custody issue pursuant to: (1) all parties' consent to the appointment and the scope of authority; (2) upon motion of a party requesting the appointment; or (3) upon the court's own motion (previously, did not provide for reappointment; specified during the proceedings of the action; did not provide for the court to make appointment upon motion of a party requesting appointment or upon its own motion). Further provides for the court to make specified findings that the action is a high-conflict case, the appointment is in the best interests of any minor child in the case, and that the parties are able to pay for the cost of the coordinator, in the event the parties have not consented to the appointment (previously, allowed the court to make the appointment without consent of the parties upon entry of a custody order other than an ex parte order, or upon entry of a parenting plan, only if those specified findings were made). Adds that the court does not have to find a substantial change of circumstance has occurred to appoint a parenting coordinator. Requires the appointing order to specify the terms of the appointment. Removes the requirements for the order to specifically incorporate any agreement regarding the role of the coordinator made by the parties. Also eliminates the requirement for the court to give a copy of the order to the parties prior to the appointment conference. Provides for selection of the parenting coordinator from a list maintained by the district court (previously, selection specifically by the court). Clarifies that prior to appointment, the court, the parties' attorneys, or the parties must contact the coordinator to determine if the coordinator is willing and able to accept the appointment.\\nAmends GS 50-92, regarding the authority of the parenting coordinator. Requires the authority to be limited to matters that will aid the parties in complying with the custody order, resolving disputes regarding issues that were not specifically addressed in the custody order, or ambiguous or conflicting terms in the custody order (previously, identify disputed issues, reduce misunderstandings, clarify priorities, explore possibilities for compromise, develop methods of collaboration in parenting, and compliance with the court's order). Now provides 20 areas which the scope of authority can, but is not limited to, including transition time, pick up, or delivery; sharing vacations and holidays; diet, clothing, extracurricular activities, and discipline. Authorizes the coordinator to decide any issue within the scope of authority, and deems the decision enforceable as an order of the court. Requires decisions to be in writing and provided to the parties and their attorneys. Deems the decision binding so long as the custody order is in effect, even after the expiration of the coordinator's term unless the coordinator or subsequent coordinator modifies the decision or the courts review and modifies the decision. Allows any party or their attorney to file a motion for the court to review a coordinator's decision. Requires the parties to comply with the decision unless the court, after a review hearing, determines the decision is not in the child's best interest or the decision exceeded the scope of authority (previously, allowed the court to authorize the coordinator to make decisions regarding implementation of the parenting plan not specifically governed by the order, binding on the parties until reviewed by the court at a hearing at the request of the coordinator or either party; did not provide specific findings the court must make in its review of the decision). Provides that the moving party or their attorney must cause a subpoena to be issued for the coordinator's attendance at the review hearing (previously, only the judge presiding over the case can subpoena the coordinator to attend and testify at the review hearing). Requires the court to determine how the coordinator's fees are to be apportioned between the parties at the conclusion of the review hearing. Further authorizes the court to review and modify the coordinator's decision after the expiration of a parenting coordinator's term (not previously provided for).

Prohibits the court from entering an appointment order or conducting a conference unless a custody order has already been entered or is simultaneously entered. Removes the requirement for the court to determine the information each party must provide to the parenting coordinator at the time of the appointment conference. Makes clarifying changes. Eliminates the provisions requiring the coordinator and any guardians ad litem to bring all necessary releases, contracts, and consents to the conference, and requiring the coordinator to schedule the first session with the parties.\\nAmends GS 50-95, concerning fees of the parenting coordinator, to now require the coordinator to file a fee report and request a hearing in the event of a dispute of fee or retainer payment (previously, the coordinator was not required to file a fee report, and disputes on retainers were not included). Now additionally provides for a party disputing the fees or the allocation of the fees to file a motion with the court requesting a review of the fees. Adds that the district court retains jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding the coordinator's fees after the conclusion of the coordinator's term so long as the coordinator's fee report was filed in a timely manner. Removes the provision authorizing the court to condition the appointment upon the parties' payment of a specified fee to the coordinator, and prohibiting the coordinator from beginning any duties until the fee has been paid.\\nExpands GS 50-96, now allowing meeting and communications between the parties, their attorneys, or any other person with information that assists the coordinator in the coordinator's duties, to be informal and ex parte. Now requires the parties to timely execute any releases necessary to facilitate communication with any person having information that assists the coordinator in the coordinator's duties, upon request of the coordinator. Authorizes the coordinator, in the coordinator's discretion, to meet or communicate with the minor children.\\u00a0\\nRewrites GS 50-97, regarding reports of the parenting coordinator. Now permits the coordinator to file a report with the court regarding any of the five specified issues, including the parenting coordinator's belief that the existing custody order is not in the best interest of the child, a party's noncompliance with a decision of the coordinator or the terms of the custody order, or the parenting coordinator's request that the appointment be modified or terminated. Provides for a hearing in the event of a party's noncompliance with the coordinator's decision, the terms of the custody order, or nonpayment of the coordinator fees (previously, provided for a hearing no later than two weeks following receipt of the required report if the coordinator made noncompliance determinations). Specifies that the provisions do not prevent a party from filing its own motion regarding noncompliance with the coordinator's decision or the terms of the custody order. Now requires an expedited hearing to be granted and occur within four weeks of the filing of the report unless the coordinator requests longer or the court has already issued an order during a party to show cause why the party should not be held in contempt. Authorizes the court to issue temporary custody orders as required for a child's best interest after a hearing on the report.\\u00a0\\nRewrites GS 50-98, regarding parenting coordinator records, to permit the coordinator to release any records held by the coordinator to the parties or their attorneys, at the discretion of the coordinator (previously, required the coordinator to provide written summaries of development and copies of other written communications to the parties and their attorneys; also required coordinators to maintain records of each meeting, which could only be subpoenaed by the presiding judge, and were reviewable in camera and released only if the court determined the records would assist the parties with the presentation of their case at trial). Now permits any party to apply to the presiding judge for the issuance of a subpoena to compel production of the coordinator's records. Requires any party submitting the application to provide reasonable notice to the coordinator and the parties so that any objection to the release of information or the manner of release can be considered prior to the issuance of the subpoena.\\u00a0\\nAmends GS 50-99, authorizing the court to terminate or modify the parenting coordinator's appointment upon motion of any party, upon the agreement of the parties, or by the court on its own motion, for good cause shown (previously, included upon motion of either party at the request of the coordinator). Now allows for the court to modify or terminate the coordinator's appointment upon request of the coordinator for good cause shown as set forth in GS 50-97(a)(5), as enacted.

Adds four objectives for which the Codifier may revise a rule: (1) to substitute one name for another when an organization or position is renamed; (2) to correct a citation in the rule to another rule or law when the citation has become inaccurate since the rule was adopted because of the repeal or renumbering of the cited rule or law; (3) to change information readily available to the public, such as an address, a telephone number, or a web site; or (4) to correct a typographical error.\\nSection 2.1 and 2.2\\nDivides existing GS 150B-22 (Settlement; contested case) into two subsections. Additionally, clarifies that a party or person aggrieved cannot be required to petition an agency for rule making or to seek or obtain a declaratory ruling before commencing a contested case under GS 150B-23 (provisions for commencement of a contested case). Makes conforming change to GS 150B-43 (Right to judicial review).\\nSection 3\\nMakes the following changes to the Administrative Procedure Act concerning the periodic review and expiration of existing rules. Eliminates the distinction between rules that are necessary with substantive public interest or necessary without substantive public interest under the provisions of GS 150B-21.3A. Eliminates those defined terms in subsection (a), and instead defines\\u00a0necessary rule\\u00a0to mean any rule other than an unnecessary rule. Makes conforming changes throughout GS 150B-21.3A to remove any language distinguishing necessary rules with or without substantive public interest.\\u00a0\\nAdditionally, amends the definition for public comment to include written comments objecting to an agency's determination of the rule as necessary or unnecessary received by an agency from any member of the public. Amends subsection (c) of GS 150B-21.3A, which sets out the review process an agency must conduct of its existing rules at least once every 10 years. Step 1 now requires the agency to evaluate all of its existing rules and submit a report to the Rules Review Commission that includes the agency\\u2019s initial determination of whether an existing rule is necessary or unnecessary, all public comments the agency received during the comment period to the agency\\u2019s initial determination, and the agency\\u2019s response to the public comment. Step 2 of the rule review process requires the Rule Review Commission (Commission) to review the agency reports required in Step 1. In its review, the Commission must determine whether a public comment to a rule that the agency determined to be unnecessary in Step 1 has merit, and if the Commission determines that the public comment has merit, then the Commission must designate the rule as necessary. Currently, a public comment only has merit if it addresses the specific substance of a rule and relates to any of the standards for review of a rule by the Commission under GS 150B-21.9(a) (the four standards for review are whether the rule is within the agency\\u2019s authority, whether the rule is clear and unambiguous, whether the rule is reasonably necessary, and whether the rule was adopted in accordance with Part 2 of Article 2A of GS Chapter 150B, Adoption of Rules). This act removes the requirement that the public comment has to relate to any of the standards for review by the Commission under GS 150B-21.9(a) to have merit for purposes of Step 2 of the rule review process under GS 150B-21.3A(c)(2). Makes conforming changes.\\nMakes organizational and technical changes to GS 150B-21.3A to combine subsections (e) and (e1), concerning exclusions from the statute's provisions. Makes conforming changes.\\u00a0\\nSection 3 applies to agency rule reports submitted to the Officer of Administrative Hearings pursuant to GS 150B-21.3A(c)(1) (Step 1 of the rule review process) on or after October 1, 2019.\\n \\n Government, APA/Rule Making, State Agencies \\n GS 150B \\n  \\n\""},

Makes conforming organizational changes.\\n \\n Education, Elementary and Secondary Education, Employment and Retirement, Government, State Government, State Personnel, Local Government, Health and Human Services, Health, Health Insurance \\n GS 44, GS 135, GS 143C \\n  \\n\\n Bill H 626 (2019-2020) \\n Summary date: Apr 9 2019 - View summary \\n Amends GS 135-6 to require at least once in each five-year period that the actuary completes an actuarial experience review of (was, make an actuarial investigation into) the mortality, service, and compensation experience of the members and beneficiaries of the\\u00a0Retirement System for Teachers and State Employees. Adds that before undertaking each quinquennial actuarial experience review, the Board of Trustees must report to the NCGA and the Governor on 12 items concerning the Retirement System, including projections of assets, liabilities, pension debt, service costs, employee contributions, employer contributions, net amortization, benefit payments, payroll, and funded ratio for the Retirement System for each of the next 30 years based upon the then-current actuarial assumptions, including the assumed rate of return, the market value of the assets controlled by the Board of Trustees and an explanation of how the actuarial value assigned to those assets differs from the market value of those assets, and an assessment of how the changes of assumptions adopted by the Board of Trustees in the experience review affect any of the other results in the report. Allows the Retirement System Division to increase receipts from the retirement assets of the corresponding retirement system or allows the payment of costs directly from the retirement assets for payment for the administration of the required actuarial experience review, required report, and annual valuation of the assets and liabilities of the System funds.\\nAmends GS 143C-4-10 to expand upon the funds received by the Unfunded Liability Solvency Reserve to also include any funds, in an amount directed by the State Treasurer to be transferred, that meet the following: (1) the funds are the result of rebates received by the Department of State Treasurer from a company administering supplemental voluntary insurance benefits authorized under specified provisions; (2) the funds are not owed to a company administering, or individuals participating in, supplemental voluntary insurance benefits; and (3) as determined by the Board of Trustees of the Retirement System, the funds are not needed to pay future administrative costs of the supplemental voluntary insurance benefits.\\nAmends GS 135-48.5, which requires that any unencumbered balance in excess of prepaid premiums or charges in the Public Employee Health Benefit Fund at the end of each fiscal year be used in three specified ways in the specified order. Adds, as the second use, that an amount determined by the State Treasurer, subject to approval by the Board of Trustees, not to exceed 50% of any unencumbered balance remaining after providing for incurred but unpresented claims, may be transferred to the Retiree Health Benefit Fund. Amends the final allowed use, which is to improve the plan, to make it as provided by the State Treasurer, subject to approval by the Board of Trustees, instead of as provided by the General Assembly. Makes additional clarifying changes.\\nAmends GS 143C-4-10 by prohibiting transferring any portion of the Retiree Health Benefit Fund to the General Fund and providing that any appropriation made to the Fund does not revert.\\nExpands GS 135-48.37, subrogating the Plan to all Plan member rights of recovery, including first-party underinsured, MedPay coverage, or third-party insurance, for all medical expenses to the extent the recovery is related to an injury caused by a liable third party. Adds new requirement for all personal injury or wrongful death claims brought by a member or a member\\u2019s representative or estate against a third party to include a claim for all medical assistance payments for health care items or services furnished to the member as a result of the injury; deems such a claim that does not include the Plan\\u2019s claim to include the Plan\\u2019s claim. Makes the Plan\\u2019s claim a lien upon any recovery a member or a member\\u2019s representative or estate obtains. Makes clarifying changes, specifying that the Plan has the right to first recovery over all nongovernmental medical liens and rights on any amounts recovered related to an injury caused by a liable third party, regardless of the timing of nongovernmental medical liens and rights in relation to the Plan\\u2019s liens and rights, who recovered the amount, or how the amount was recovered. Allows the Plan to recover amounts the Plan is entitled to from the member, the member\\u2019s representative or estate, or the insurance company (previously, just the member) in the event the member or the member\\u2019s representative or estate (previously, just the member) recovers any amount from a liable third party. Makes further changes to make the provisions regarding the Plan\\u2019s rights and remedies against members also applicable to members' representatives or estates. Creates a new notification requirement, requiring the members, the member\\u2019s representative or estate, or the insurance company to notify the Plan within 14 days of receipt of the proceeds of a settlement or judgment related to a claim under the statute. Further, requires the member, the member\\u2019s representative or estate, or the insurance company to distribute the sufficient amount to satisfy the Plan\\u2019s lien to the Plan within 30 days of receipt of the proceeds of a settlement or judgment. Provides for the Plan to recover the amount directly through any available remedy. Adds to the prohibition against a lien of the Plan exceeding 50% of the total damages recovered by the member, excluding from the calculation the member\\u2019s reasonable and proportionate costs of collection, conclusively determined by the Plan (previously, excluded the member\\u2019s reasonable costs of collection only). Adds new provisions providing for situations when liens have priority over the Plan\\u2019s right to first recovery. Specifically prohibits the deduction of other liens from the Plan\\u2019s right to to recover under the statute. Adds that in the event insufficient funds remain to fully satisfy the Plan\\u2019s lien after deducting the member\\u2019s or member\\u2019s representative or estate\\u2019s costs of collection and any priority liens from the total damages recovered, the Plan is entitled to the remaining balance of the total damages recovered.\\nAmends Section 3 of SL 2018-84, concerning charter schools electing to cease participation in the Teachers' and State Employees' Retirement System alternatively making payment on withdrawal liability on a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment. Now sunsets the section June 14, 2023.

Makes the following changes to subdivision (c)(3a). Defines collaborative care services to mean patient care services authorized by a physician and delegated to a pharmacist for the purpose of drug therapy and disease management. Now requires the provision of patient care services by a licensed pharmacist under a collaborative practice agreement with one or more physicians to be performed in accordance with the rules developed by the NC Medical Board and the NC Board of Pharmacy and approved by both Boards. Authorizes a supervising physician to delegate to a licensed pharmacist, under a collaborative practice agreement, any patient care services that the supervising physician deems appropriate. Eliminates existing provisions of subdivision (c)(3a) that included the provision of drug therapy management, defined to include implementing drug therapy and ordering tests by a licensed pharmacist engaged in the practice of pharmacy pursuant to an agreement that is physician, pharmacist, patient and disease specific when performed in accordance with the Boards' rules and approved by the Boards).\\nMakes conforming changes to GS 90-18.4 concerning clinical pharmacist practitioners. Modifies the conditions to which clinical pharmacist practitioners authorized by physicians to provide patient care in accordance with GS 90-18(c)(3a) and GS 90-18.4A are subject. Now requires the Boards to have adopted rules developed by a joint subcommittee governing the use and oversight of collaborative practice in patient care settings that the Boards have determined to be in the best interest of patient health and safety. Additionally requires clinical pharmacist practitioners to register with the Board of Pharmacy and maintain annual requirements as a clinical pharmacist practitioner (previously only required current approval from both Boards), and requires the clinical pharmacist practitioner's unique identification number to be shown on any prescriptions he or she writes (previously required the Medical Board to assign an ID number to be written on prescriptions written by him or her). Eliminates the condition which required the agreement to prohibit the substitution of chemically dissimilar drug products without explicit consent of the physician and to provide for periodic review by the physician of the drugs modified. Adds a new subsection to require the supervising physician to evaluate the provision of collaborative care services by the clinical pharmacist practitioner in accordance with rules adopted by the Boards. Requires the physician to conduct periodic review and evaluation of the clinical pharmacist practitioner as stated in their agreement. Authorizes the physician to collaborate with and supervise as many clinical pharmacist practitioners as the physician deems safe and effective. Repeals subdivisions (c)(1)-(4) regarding conditions for certain clinical pharmacist practitioners working in hospitals and other facilities to order medications and tests from the facility's prescription drug formulary or other lists of drugs to be utilized in the facility. Recodifies subdivision (c)(5) as subsection (c1) and modifies it to now provide as follows. Requires any drug therapy order medications, tests, or devices written by a clinical pharmacist practitioner to be deemed authorized by the collaborating physician. Requires orders written by a clinical pharmacist practitioner to be documented to inform the collaborating physician or advanced practice provider for the patient. Requires the supervising physician to conduct periodic review and evaluation of the clinical pharmacist practitioner's prescribing patterns. Adds new subsection (c2) to allow institutional and group practices to implement an institution-wide, multiprovider collaborative practice agreement for the care of their patients under a policy for oversight and evaluation of clinical pharmacist practitioners by an appointed supervising physician. Repeals subsection (d), which authorized any registered nurse or licensed practical nurse who receives a drug therapy order from a clinical pharmacist practitioner for medications or tests to perform that order in the same manner as if the order was received from a licensed physician.\\nAmends GS 90-8.2 to allow rather than mandate the Medical Board to appoint and maintain a subcommittee to work with a subcommittee of the Pharmacy Board to develop rules to govern the performance of patient care services by clinical pharmacist practitioners. Authorizes the Pharmacy Board to determine reasonable fees to accompany the registry application not to exceed $50 and annual renewal of registration not to exceed $50 (previously required of the Medical Board with an initial application fee of $100 and renewal of $50). Requires rules recommended by the joint subcommittee to be made and adopted compliant with GS Chapter 150B (APA) by both Boards within six months of any approved statutory changes (was not effective until adopted by both Boards). Now places the responsibility to ensure compliance with collaborative practice rules with the Pharmacy Board rather than the Medical Board.\\nEnacts GS 90-18.4A (substantively similar to GS 90-18.4(b)(4), as repealed) to permit a collaborative practice agreement to include a statement of authorization regarding the clinical pharmacist practitioner's authority to conduct drug substitutions within the same therapeutic class. Requires documentation of any substitutions and notification of the physician. Requires the agreement to include a policy for periodic review by the physician regarding therapeutic substitutions made. Allows physicians to add advanced practice providers to an agreement if supervised in a manner separate from the collaborative practice agreement, so long as evaluation and supervision of the clinical pharmacist practitioner remains with the supervising physician.\\nAmends GS 90-85.3(b2), under the NC Pharmacy Act, Article 4A, to now define a clinical pharmacist practitioner as a licensed pharmacist who (1) provides collaborative care under a written collaborative practice agreement with one or more physicians, (2) has registered with the Pharmacy Board, (3) meets and maintains required annual professional development requirements, (4) maintains good standing with the Pharmacy Board, and (5) practices in accordance with GS 90-18.4, as amended, and rules established by the joint subcommittee of the Boards. Also defines\\u00a0collaborative care services\\u00a0as it is defined in GS 90-18(c)(3a), as amended.\\nEnacts GS 90-85.11B to direct the Pharmacy Board to maintain a registry of all pharmacists engaged in collaborative practice and to issue and track numbers unique to each participating pharmacist.\\u00a0\\nApplies to licenses granted or renewed on or after October 1, 2019.\\n \\n Business and Commerce, Occupational Licensing, Health and Human Services, Health, Health Care Facilities and Providers \\n GS 90 \\n  \\n\""},

Makes conforming changes to require the taxpayer to add such amount excluded from gross income under the decoupling adjustment provisions.\\u00a0\\nPart II. Franchise Tax Changes\\nAmends GS 105\\u00ad-120.2 (Franchise or privilege tax on holding companies). Currently provides for the tax to be the higher of the two rates described in GS 105\\u00ad120.2(b)(1) and GS 105\\u00ad120.2(b)(2). Eliminates the specified rates. Instead provides for each rate to be set at the rate provided in GS 105-122(d2), as amended, per $1,000. Maintains that the first rate cannot be less than $200 or exceed $150,000. Now provides that the second rate is per $1,000 on the total actual investment in tangible property in the State as computed under GS 105-122(d), eliminating the requirement of using the greater of that option or 55% of the appraised value of all the real and tangible property in the State plus the appraised value of intangible property. Makes conforming repeal of GS 105-122(d)(2) (possibly intends subsection (d)).\\nAmends GS 105\\u00ad-122 (Franchise or privilege tax on domestic and foreign corporations). Adjusts the tax rate to set the tax rate for an electric power company or a company that is a member of a qualified group at $1.50 per $1,000 of the company's tax base.

Market-based Sourcing for Multistate Income Tax Apportionment\\nAmends GS 105-130.4 (allocation and apportionment of income for corporations). Concerning the sales factor, establishes that receipts are in the State if the taxpayer's market for the receipts is in the State. Provides for reasonable approximation if the market for a receipt cannot be determined, and if that method is not possible, the receipts must be excluded from the denominator of a taxpayer's sales factor. Makes organizational changes to the parameters regarding a taxpayer's market for receipts in the State, and makes clarifying changes concerning the sale, rental, lease, or license of real property; the rental, lease, or license of tangible property; the sale of service; the rental, lease or license of intangible property; and the sale of tangible property. Distinguishes the meaning of \\\"used in the State\\\" in determining the market for receipts for the rental, lease or license of intangible property and the sale of intangible property.\\nEstablishes new subsections to provide that a broadcaster's market and a bank's market for receipts in the State are provided in new GS 105-130.4A.\\nEstablishes a new subsection to set forth parameters to determine the fraction for the apportionable income of an electric power company, defined as a company, including any of its wholly owned noncorporate limited liability companies, primarily engaged in the business of supplying electricity for light, heat, current, or power to persons in the State and that is subject to control of the NC Utilities Commission and/or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Provides that the rules apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020.\\nPart IV. Marketplace Facilitators to Collect Sales Tax\\nAmends GS 105-164.3 to add the terms\\u00a0marketplace,\\u00a0marketplace facilitated sale,\\u00a0marketplace facilitator, and\\u00a0marketplace seller to the defined terms applicable to Article 5, Sales and Use Tax.\\nAmends GS 105-164.8 to expand the scope of the tax to a retailer who makes a remote sale in the State by soliciting or transacting business in the State by employees, independent contractors, agents or other representatives, whether the remote sales subject to State tax result from or are related in any other way to the solicitation or transaction or transaction of business. Modifies the presumption of solicitation or transacting business by a representative to include if the retailer enters into an agreement with a resident of the State which the person (was, resident) directly or indirectly refers potential customers to the retailer for a commission or other consideration. Makes conforming changes. Also subjects to the tax a retailer who makes remote sales sourced in the State for the previous or current calendar year with either gross sales over $100,000 or two hundred or more separate transactions (was, for the current calendar year). Adds that this provision include sales as a marketplace seller, as now defined in GS 105-164.3, sourced in the State.\\nAdds a new provision to subject a retailer who makes remote sales to the State tax if the retailer is a marketplace facilitator, as now defined in GS 105-164.3, that makes sales, including marketplace facilitated sales for all marketplace sellers, as those terms are now defined in GS 105-164.3, sourced to the State for the previous or the current calendar year that either has gross sales in excess of $100,000 or two hundred or more separate transactions. Enacts GS 105-164.4J to establish that a marketplace facilitator meeting this threshold is considered the retailer of each marketplace facilitated sale it makes and is liable for collecting and remitting the sales and use tax on all such sales and treat the sales as a wholesale sale. Requires the marketplace facilitator to comply with the same requirements and procedures as other retailers required to be registered and collect and remits sales and use tax in the State. Clarifies that the requirement applies regardless of whether a marketplace seller for whom the marketplace facilitator makes a marketplace facilitated sale has a physical presence in the State; is required to be registered to collect and remit sales and use tax to the State; would have been required to collect and remit sales and use tax in the State had the sale not been made through a marketplace; and would not have been required to collect and remit sales and use tax in the State had the sale not been made through a marketplace.

Clarifies that a customer's right to seek a refund as provided in GS 105-164.11 is not affected. Allows for a marketplace facilitator and a marketplace seller to enter into an agreement regarding fulfillment of Article 5's requirements, but prohibits a marketplace seller from agreeing to collect and remit sales and use tax on marketplace facilitated sales. Maintains that the use tax obligation of a customer is not affected by a marketplace facilitator's failure to collect and remits sales or use tax. Excludes from the statute an accommodation facilitator, an admission facilitator, or a service contract facilitator whose collection and remittance requirements are set out in specified existing law.\\nAmends GS 105-237.1 to expand instances in which the Secretary of Revenue (Secretary) can compromise a taxpayer's liability for tax collected under GS 105-241.22 to include when a marketplace facilitator can show to the Secretary's satisfaction that the failure to collect the correct amount of tax was due to incorrect information given to the marketplace facilitator by the marketplace seller.\\u00a0\\nFurther amends GS 105-164.3 to add the terms accommodation and accommodation facilitator. Deletes the definitions subsection from GS 105-164.4F (Accommodation rentals). In calculating the gross receipts derived from the rental of an accommodation, the sales price of the rental of an accommodation made by an accommodation facilitator, which is now defined to include a real estate broker, includes charges designated as facilitation fees, service fees, listing fees, and any other charges necessary to complete the rental (was, previously specified made by a facilitator rather than marketed, and did not include specifically include charges for service fees or listing fees). Now establishes that the liability of an accommodation facilitator for the tax relieves the provider of the accommodation from liability. Defines\\u00a0retailer\\u00a0for purposes of the statute as a provider of the accommodation that meets specified criteria or the accommodation facilitator if it collects payment or a deposit for the accommodation at the time of the reservation. Modifies existing provisions to apply them to a transaction in which the rental of an accommodation is made by an accommodation facilitator but the provider of the accommodation is considered the retailer. Adds a new requirement for the accommodation facilitator to file with the Secretary an annual electronic report by March 31 of each year for the prior calendar year for accommodation rentals for which its is not considered the retailer, including the specified content. Now exempts from the tax a private residence, cottage, or similar accommodation that is rented for fewer than 15 days in a calendar year unless the accommodation is rented by an accommodation facilitator that is considered the retailer (was, other than that listed with a real estate broker or agent). Makes further conforming changes.\\nFurther amends GS 105-164.3 to define\\u00a0admission charge,\\u00a0admission facilitator,\\u00a0amenity, and\\u00a0entertainment activity\\u00a0(identical to the terms defined in GS 105-164.4G, with the exception of the more specific terminology of\\u00a0admission facilitator\\u00a0rather than facilitator). Makes conforming deletions to GS 105-164.4G (Entertainment activity) and makes changes to refer to an admission facilitator rather than a facilitator throughout.\\nFurther amends GS 105-164.3 to define\\u00a0service contract facilitator\\u00a0(identical to the existing definition of\\u00a0facilitator\\u00a0in GS 105-164.4I). Makes conforming deletions to GS 105-164.4I (Service contracts) and make changes to refer to a service contract facilitator rather than a facilitator throughout.\\nAmends GS 105-164.22 regarding recordkeeping requirements, inspection authority, and effect of failure to keep records.

Requires wholesale merchant's records to establish that a sale is exempt from tax and any reports or records related to transactions with a facilitator with whom it has a contract under the Article. Adds that a consumer's records must include on the invoice any sales and use tax paid on the purchase price of an item purchased from inside or outside the State. Makes further organizational and conforming\\u00a0 changes.\\nFurther amends GS 105-164.3 to modify the definitions of\\u00a0advertising and promotional direct mail\\u00a0and\\u00a0bundled transaction\\u00a0to refer to an item rather than a product. Adds the term\\u00a0affiliate. Amends\\u00a0engaged in business\\u00a0to include permanently or temporarily, whether directly or through a subsidiary, having a marketplace facilitator subject to the requirements of GS 105-164.4J, as enacted, or a solicitor transacting business by mobile phone application or other applications in the State; also now includes making marketplace facilitated sales subject to the requirements of GS 105-164.4J, as enacted.

Amends\\u00a0repair, maintenance, and installation services\\u00a0to include activities listed\\u00a0 on certain digital property (was digital property). Amends\\u00a0retailer\\u00a0to refer to sales at retail of items (rather than tangible personal property, digital property for storage, use, or consumption in the State, or services) sourced to the State.

Regarding the timeline for mandatory connection to the HIE Network, adds the State Laboratory of Public Health is to begin submitting demographic and clinical data by June 1, 2021. Also requires State health care facilities operating under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), such as alcohol and drug treatment centers and residential programs for children, to begin submitting claims data by June 1, 2021. Eliminates the provisions of the previous edition which required both the State Lab for Public Health and State health care facilities operated by the DHHS Secretary to begin submitting demographic and clinical data by June 1 of the fiscal year following the implementation of an electronic health record system or other technology enabling connectivity to the HIE Network. Makes conforming changes. Adds consultation with the State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees (SHP) to the procedures for granting limited extensions to the time for providers and entities to connect to the HIE Network and begin submitting data as required. Now prohibits the Department of Information Technology, DHHS, or the SHP from granting an extension (1) to a provider or entity that fails to provide the expected timeline for connection and data submission to the Department, DHHS, and the SHP (2) which would result in the provider or entity connecting and commencing data submission later than June 1, 2020 (previously extended to June 1, 2021), or (3) which would result in any provider or entity required to begin data submission by June 1, 2021 (specified in subdivisions (a1)(4) and (5)), to connect and commence data submission later than June 1, 2022 (previously eliminated; current law provides for June 1, 2021). Concerning the hardship exemption set forth in proposed subsection (a3), grants the Secretary or a designee the authority to grant the hardship exemptions to classes of providers and requires prompt notification of the Department of Information Technology of the classes of providers granted hardship exemptions (previously directed DHHS to establish an exemption process in consultation with the Department of Information Technology, providing factors to consider in determining undue hardship, and requiring written requests for the exception; did require prompt notification of providers granted exemptions). Adds a new provision to prohibit the Secretary or a designee from granting a hardship exemption that would result in any class of provider connection to the HIE Network and submitting data later than December 31, 2022. Modifies and adds to the providers included in proposed subsection (e), which provides for voluntary connection of those listed. Adds community-based long-term services and supports providers; intellectual and developmental disability services and supports providers; eye and vision services providers; and ambulance providers. Eliminates from that list respiratory, rehabilitative, restorative, assistive technology, and intellectual and developmental disability service providers; personal care; home health providers; hospice service providers and respite care service providers. Now refers in that list to local education agencies rather than referencing individual agencies. Concerning the confidentiality of HIE Network data, adds that data submitted to or through the Network containing protected health information, personally identifying information, or any combination thereof, in possession of the Department of Information Technology or any other agency, is confidential (previously did not provide for any combination of protected health or personally identifying information, and did not extend confidentiality to that information in the possession of other state agencies).

Specifies that the June 1, 2018, start date for providing demographic and clinical data applies to the specified providers of Medicaid services licensed to operate in the State (previously did not require licensure in the State) that have an electronic health record system and specifies that the demographic and clinical data is the minimum of what is to be submitted.

Requires using the term \\\"telehealth\\\" instead of\\u00a0 \\\"telemedicine\\\" in all clinical coverage policies. Defines telehealth for the purposes of Medicaid and NC Health Choice coverage, as the delivery of health care-related services by a Medicaid or NC Health Choice provider licensed in the State to a Medicaid or NC Health Choice recipient through one of the three specified types of communications and technologies. Specifies that telehealth does not include the delivery of services solely through electronic mail, text chat, or audio-communication unless either additional medical history and clinical information is communicated electronically between the provider and patient or the services delivered are behavioral health services. Specifies four actions that DHHS must take regarding Medicaid and NC Health Choice coverage of telehealth services, including promoting access to health care for Medicaid and NC Health Choice recipients through telehealth services. Prohibits DHHS from requiring seven specified items as a condition of coverage of telehealth services, including that a provider be part of a telehealth network in order to bill for Medicaid or NC Health Choice services, and that the Provider be physically present with the patient or client unless the provider determines it is medically necessary to perform the services in person. Requires DHHS to ensure that (1) Medicaid and NC Health Choice coverage and reimbursement for telehealth services are equivalent to the reimbursement and coverage for the same services if provided in person and (2) that any deductible, copayment, or coinsurance requirement is equivalent to the same service if it was provided to the patient in person. Requires DHHS to submit to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services any waivers or amendments to the NC Medicaid State Plan necessary to implement the above provisions.

Defines\\u00a0development permit\\u00a0to include zoning permits, site plan approvals, special use permits, variances, certificates of appropriateness, plat approvals, development agreements, building permits, subdivision of land, State agency permits for development, driveway permits, erosion and sedimentation control permits, and sign permits. Specifies that a rule or ordinance amendment includes an amendment to any applicable land development regulation. Adds further specifications for permit choice, including: (1) allowing the applicant to act on the permit without awaiting the outcome of a rule, map, or ordinance amendment if the applicant chooses the version of the rule applicable at the time of the permit application and (2) providing for permit choice in instances where an applicable rule or ordinance is amended after the development permit is wrongfully denied or after an illegal condition is imposed, determined as specified. Prohibits the enforcement of any provision of the applicant's chosen version of the rule or ordinance determined to be illegal for any reason without the written consent of the applicant.

Amends the statute concerning written comments by citizens of proposed amendments, modifications, or repeals of zoning ordinances, to specify that the comments and procedure are limited to those proposed amendments, modifications, or repeals of zoning ordinances that have been properly initiated as provided in GS 160A-384, and include changes to zoning maps or texts. Makes orgnanizational changes to GS 153A-344, concerning changes in county zoning ordinances, recodifying GS 153A-344(b1) as GS 153A-344(b)(5).\\nFurther amends GS 160A-385 (concerning cities) and GS 153A-344, to provide that amendments to land development regulations are not applicable or enforceable without the written consent of the owner with regard to: (1) buildings or uses of buildings or land for which a development permit application has been submitted and issued pursuant to GS 143-755, as amended; (2) subdivisions of land for which a development permit authorizing the subdivision has been submitted and issued pursuant to GS 143-755, as amended; (3) a vested right established pursuant to GS 160A-385.1 or GS 153A-344.1 that remains valid and unexpired under GS 160A-385.1 or GS 153A-385.1 (appears to intend, or GS 153A-344.1); (4) a vested right established by the terms of the development agreement authorized by Part 3D of Article 19, GS Chapter 160A, or Part 2D of Article 18, GS Chapter 153A; and (5) a multi-phased development in accordance with GS 143-755, as amended (previously provided for limited enforcement of amended zoning ordinances without consent for buildings and uses for which valid and unexpired permits were issued or rights were vested as specified; restricted the limited enforcement of amended zoning, subdivision, and unified development ordinances without written consent to multi-phased developments). Now provides that multi-phased developments are vested for the entire development with land development ordinances (previously referred to the zoning ordinances, subdivision ordinances, and unified development ordinances) in place at the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development, with the right vested for seven years from the time a site plan approval is granted for the initial phase of the multi-phased development. Previously, both GS 160A-385 and GS 153A-344 defined\\u00a0multi-phased development\\u00a0to mean the same as defined in GS 160A-385.1(b)(7) or GS 153A-344.1(b)(7), which each define the term to mean a development containing 100 acres or more submitted for site plan approval for construction to occur in more than one phase and is subject to a master plan with committed elements, including a requirement to offer land for public use as a condition of its master development plan approval. Now defines\\u00a0multi-phase developmentin GS 160A-385 and GS 153A-344 to mean a development containing 25 acres or more that is both submitted for development permit approval to occur in more than one phase and subject to a master development plan with committed elements showing the type and intensity of use of each phase. Makes conforming deletions to GS 160A-385.1 and GS 153A-344.1.\\nAdds new provisions concerning the statutory vesting granted by GS 160A-385 and GS 153A-344, providing that the vested rights established pursuant to the statutes are effective upon filing of the development permit application pursuant to GS 143-755 for so long as the permit remains valid under the law. Provides that local development permits expire one year after issuance unless work authorized by the permit has substantially commenced or otherwise specified by statute. Clarifies that a permit is issued either in the ordinary course of business of the agency or by the applicable governmental agency as a court directive. Adds that vested rights established under the statutes do not preclude vesting under one or more subdivisions of the respective statute or by application of common law principles. Establishes that established vested rights preclude any action by a city or county that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish or otherwise delay the development or use as provided in the development permit application, except where a change in State or federal law mandated enforcement after the application that has a fundamental and retroactive effect on development or use.

Removes existing language which requires actual notice to affected landowners for requests for zoning map amendments which are not made by the land owner, to instead prohibit any zoning map amendment to be initiated or enforceable without the written consent of all property owners whose property is the subject of the zoning map amendment. Maintains the exception for the initiation and enforcement of zoning map amendments by cities and counties.\\nAmends GS 160A-388, regarding appeals to the board of adjustment of administrative decisions regarding the enforcement of land use and/or development regulations. Now requires written notice of the administrative decision to include language that the determination is final and that the party for whom the notice is given has a right to appeal in order for the decision to be effective. Further, now specifies that an appeal of a notice of violation or other enforcement order stays enforcement of the action appealed including any accumulation of fines during the pendency of the appeal to the board of adjustment and any subsequent appeal pursuant to GS 160A-393 (quasi-judicial decisions appealed to superior court) or during the pendency of any civil proceeding authorized by law, including GS 160A-393.1, as enacted, or appeals therefrom, unless the official certifies a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or would seriously interfere with the enforcement of the ordinance.\\nEnacts GS 160A-393.1, allowing a person claiming a statutory or common law vested right to have the right reviewed by the zoning administrator or other officer designated by regulation, whose decision can be appealed to the board of adjustment under GS 160A-388(b1). Alternatively to judicial review, provides for the person claiming the vested right to bring a civil action for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, damages, or any other remedies available by law, in superior court or federal court to challenge the enforceability, validity, or effect of a local land development regulation, for the specified claims. Provides for the procedure of the civil action, standing of a claimant, and joinder of the claim. Requires the action be brought within one year of the date on which written notice of the final decision is delivered to the aggrieved party. Provides that the definitions of GS 143-755, as amended, apply. Makes conforming changes to GS 160A-364.1.\\nAmends GS 160A-393, concerning superior court review of appealed administrative decisions, to now require a court to allow the record to be supplemented with evidence to the extent the petition raises standing, impartiality, or scope of review issues, as previously specified (previously allowable at the court's discretion). Adds that the rules of discovery set forth in the NC Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the supplementation of the record of those described issues. Specifies that the court can review the decision-making board's decision as specified to ensure the rights of the petitioner were not prejudiced because the decision-making body's decisions, inferences, conclusions, or decisions were in excess of the statutory authority conferred to the city, including preemption (previously did not explicitly include preemption).\\u00a0Makes clarifying changes regarding the court's scope of review. Specifies that the term competent evidence excludes items noted in sub-subdivisions a., b., and c. of subdivision (k)(1) that are conclusively incompetent (constitutional violations, exceeding statutory authority, and inconsistent with statutory or adopted ordinance procedure). Further clarifies that competent evidence does not include opinion testimony of lay witnesses as to property use, vehicular traffic, or matters for which only expert testimony would be admissible, regardless of the lack of timely objection. Modifies the provisions regarding relief the court may grant the petitioner, now requiring the court to remand if the court determines the permit was wrongfully denied because the denial was not based on substantial competent evidence or was otherwise based on an error of law, with instructions that the permit be issued, subject to any conditions expressly consented to by the permit applicant as part of the application or during the board of adjustment appeal or writ of certiorari appeal (previously was permissive, and the remand with instruction to issue the permit was subject to reasonably and appropriate conditions). Adds a new provision requiring the court to reverse a zoning board decision if it finds that the decision upholding a zoning enforcement action was not supported by substantial competent evidence or was otherwise based on an error of law.\\nEnacts GS 160A-393.2, prohibiting a city or county from asserting an estoppel defense before any board of adjustment or in any civil action if the landowner or permit applicant is challenging conditions that were illegally imposed.\\nAmends GS 6-21.7, requiring a court to award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the party who successfully challenged a city or county action that was found to have violated a statute or case law setting forth unambiguous limits on its authority (previously, allowed the award of fees and costs upon finding the city or county acted outside its scope of authority, and required the award upon finding the action was an abuse of discretion). Defines\\u00a0unambiguous. Adds a provision to require the court to award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the party who successfully challenged a city or county's noncompliance or violation of GS 160A-360.1, GS 153A-320.1, or GS 143-755, as amended by the act. Clarifies that the court can award reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in all other matters to the prevailing litigant.\\u00a0\\nAmends GS 160A-381 and GS 153A-340, explicitly restricting cities and counties from issuing special use permits or conditional use permits that impose unenforceable regulations or restrictions, including without limitation taxes, impact fees, building design elements not voluntarily offered by the petitioner, street improvements in excess of those authorized, driveway improvements in excess of those authorized, or other unauthorized limitations on the development or use of land, as specified. Prohibits the denial of a development permit authorized by GS 160A-381(c) and GS 153A-340(c1) on the basis that existing public facilities are inadequate to serve the property described in the permit application regardless of the type of use or development of said property.\\nAmends GS 160A-382 and GS 153A-342 regarding the placement of property in special use districts, conditional use districts, or conditional districts. Prohibits cities and counties from requiring, enforcing, or incorporating into the zoning regulations or permit requirements any condition or requirement not authorized by otherwise applicable law, including without limitation requirements as specified (identical to those unauthorized limitations specified in GS 160A-381 and GS 153A-340, as specified).\\nAmends GS 160A-307 regarding city curb cut regulations. Prohibits a city from requiring an applicant to acquire right-of-way from property not owned by the applicant, but allows an applicant to voluntarily agree to acquire the right-of-way. Removes the provision that held the more stringent driveway regulation controlling where the Department of Transportation and the city driveway improvements conflict.\\nAmends GS 160A-390 and GS 153A-346, prohibiting the use of a definition of\\u00a0building,\\u00a0dwelling,\\u00a0dwelling unit,\\u00a0bedroom, or\\u00a0sleeping unit\\u00a0inconsistent with any definition of the same in other State law, including the State Building Code Council (previously, did not include building or dwelling within the scope and limited the prohibition to using definitions that are more expansive than those in other State law; did not explicitly include the Council).\\nApplies to ordinances adopted before, on, and after the date the act becomes law.

Subject to federal law, allows a board to deny an applicant on the basis of a criminal conviction only if the board finds that the criminal conviction history is directly related to the duties and responsibilities for the licensed occupation or the criminal conviction is violent or sexual in criminal nature. Explicitly prohibits a board from automatically denying licensure on the basis of the applicant's criminal history (previously, qualified the prohibition by stating that the laws governing a particular licensing board controls), and adds a new explicit prohibition against a board denying licensure based on a determination that a conviction is for a crime of moral turpitude. Maintains\\u00a0the eight existing factors the board must consider prior to denying licensure on the basis of a criminal conviction, and adds to the factors required to be considered (1) the completion of or active participation in rehabilitative drug or alcohol treatment and (2) a certificate of relief granted under state law (previously, did not add to the factors; instead, previously required a certificate of relief to be considered favorably).\\u00a0Adds a new requirement for a board that denies an applicant a license to: (1) make written findings specifying which of the ten factors the board deemed relevant to the applicant and explaining its reasoning for the denial, signed by the board's presiding officer; (2) provide or serve a signed copy of the written findings to the applicant within 60 days of the denial; and (3) retain a signed copy of the written findings for no less than five years.

Grants an applicant 30 days to either correct any inaccuracy in the record or submit evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation for the board's consideration.

Provides that express intent exists, unless the instrument otherwise provides, if the instrument uses the language \\\"joint tenants with right of survivorship,\\\" \\\"joint tenants,\\\" \\\"joint tenancy,\\\" \\\"tenants in common with right of survivorship,\\\" \\\"joint with right of survivorship,\\\" or \\\"with right of survivorship.\\\"\\u00a0\\nEancts GS 41-72, incorporating GS 41-2(b), to establish that the interests of joint tenants in a joint tenancy with right of survivorship are equal unless the instrument of conveyance provides otherwise. This provision applies to any conveyance of an interest in property created at any time that explicitly seeks to create unequal ownership interest in a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. Provides that distributions made prior to October 1, 2009, that were made in unequal amounts from a joint tenancy with right of survivorship that sought to create unequal ownership remain valid and are not subject to modification on the basis of this provision. Declares that for a joint tenancy interest conveyed to individuals married to each other (rather than husband and wife) and to one or more other joint tenants in the same conveyance instrument, the interest held by the married individuals is a tenancy by the entirety, and the married individuals are to be treated as a single joint tenant unless the instrument provides otherwise.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\nEnacts GS 41-73. Details six events that result in severance of a joint tenancy with right of survivorship. Events terminating a joint tenancy due to the collective action of all tenants include: (1) conveyance to a third party by all tenants of all of their interests held in the property, (2) execution of an instrument with a third party that does not convey all of their interests held in the property to the third party, and (3) execution of an instrument by all joint tenants with the express intent to terminate the joint tenancy. Events terminating a joint tenancy due to the unilateral action of a joint tenant include: (1) conveyance to a third party or parties of all of that joint tenant's interests in the property, (2) execution of an instrument with a third party by a joint tenant that does not convey all of that joint tenant's interest to the third party, and (3) execution of an instrument by the joint tenant where the joint tenant is both the grantor and the grantee with the express intent to terminate. Details the creation of a tenancy in common upon severance, with variations depending on the event that triggered severance, incorporating GS 41-2(a). Specifies three events that do not result in severance of a joint tenancy with right of survivorship: (1) the filing of a judgment against one joint tenant; (2) the filing of a petition by one joint tenant in bankruptcy; or (3) the divorce of married individuals holding an interest as tenants by the entirety in a joint tenancy with one or more other joint tenants, unless the divorced individuals agree otherwise, with the divorced individuals then holding their existing interest equally as tenants in common. Clarifies that the statute does not limit the manner or effect of a severance ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\\u00a0\\nEnacts GS 41-74, incorporating GS 41-2(b) to provide that joint tenant interests among two or more joint tenants holding property in joint tenancy with right of survivorship are subject to GS 28A-24-3 (requirement of survival by 120 hours) upon the death of one or more of the joint tenants.\\nEnacts GS 41-75 to exempt from the Article's provisions executors or trustees in their representative capacity, partnerships governed by GS Chapter 59, business entities, accounts established under GS 41-2.1 (right of survivorship in bank deposits created by written agreement) or GS 41-2.2 (joint ownership of securities) to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of the statute, and life estates.\\nEnacts GS 41-76 to establish that common law and principles of equity supplement the Article, but in the event of conflict, the Article or state law controls.\\u00a0\\nRepeals the remainder of GS 41-2, which is not incorporated in the new Article.\\n \\n Courts/Judiciary, Civil, Civil Law, Development, Land Use and Housing, Property and Housing \\n GS 41 \\n  \\n\""},

Amends innovative school operator (IS operator) to remove the general prohibition provided against the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) being selected as an IS operator. Deletes the existing definition for qualifying school and now defines the term to mean a school meeting one of the following three criteria based on performance in the school year prior to identification: (1) a Title I school in the lowest-performing 5 percent of school grades of all Title I schools, (2) a school serving students in grades 9-12 that failed to graduate one-third or more of its students, and/or (3) a school identified by the State Board as being in need of comprehensive support and improvement under specified federal law due to at least one consistently underperforming subgroup.\\u00a0\\nDeletes the existing provisions regarding selection of innovative schools set forth in GS 115C-75.7 and instead mandates annual selection by the State Board of no more than five qualifying schools to transfer to the Innovative School District (ISD) as innovative schools (previously, the State Board was authorized to select, upon recommendation of the ISD Superintendent, up to five qualifying elementary schools, as previously defined, to transfer to the ISD, with diversity requirements and limitations to one qualifying school per local unit unless the local board consented). Requires selection of innovative schools to be based on an analysis and evaluation of performance of qualifying schools over a three-year period of the school being designated and placed on the qualifying list, watch list, and warning list, as described, with public notice given and hearings held concerning the designation in accordance with the statutory requirements set forth. Requires the State Board to ensure that the qualifying schools identified for any ISD list are engaged in strategies in compliance with state or federal law for comprehensive support and improvement. Directs the ISD Superintendent to monitor the schools and assist local boards in identifying funding, strategies, and partners for those efforts.

Maintains the statute's existing provisions regarding public notification and waiver for innovative schools. Requires the ISD lists and selected innovative schools to be publicly available on a website maintained by the ISD.\\nAmends GS 115C-75.8 to permit the State Board to select an IS operator or an IS consultant for a selected innovative school by December 15 and require selection of either for a selected innovative school by January 15 (previously limited to selection of an IS operator and was applicable to prospective innovative schools, with selection permitted by January and required by February 15). Makes conforming changes. Modifies the requirements for entities contracted as an IS operator or IS consultant to remove reference to persistently low-performing schools or students concerning the entity's record of improvement. Eliminates the provisions which provides for the ISD to act as an IS operator in instances in which no entity meets the specified qualifications. Requires the State Board to determine whether an innovative school should be assigned an IS operator or an IS consultant based on specific school needs. Mandates that a school assigned an IS consultant must continue to be operated by the local unit and meet the requirements established by the ISD Superintendent and the IS consultant for at least a five-year period. Adds that an innovative school that fails to meet the requirements must be assigned an IS operator by the State Board. Maintains the contract requirements for contracts between the State Board and IS operator.\\nAmends GS 115C-75.9 to limit the scope of the provisions to innovative schools under the direct management of an IS operator. Eliminates the provision authorizing the ISD to act as an IS operator in the event that temporary management is necessary due to contract termination. Now permits an IS operator, in collaboration rather than in consultation with the ISD Superintendent, to elect to enter into a memorandum of understanding for alternate arrangements with the local board to address facility and capital expenditures, transportation services, or services for children with disabilities. Adds a requirement for the IS operator to collaborate with the ISD Superintendent in selecting and hiring the school principal for the innovative school. Concerning retained employees, allows a retained employee to become an employee of the local board if the IS operator is a local board, rather than an employee of the ISD, subject to approval of the ISD Superintendent. Provides for teachers at qualifying schools selected to become an innovative school who have career status prior to selection to teach at the innovative school to return to a public school in the local unit with career status at the end of employment at the innovative school if the appropriate position is available, and if not available, be put on a list of available teachers pursuant to GS 115C-325.\\u00a0\\nAmends GS 115C-75.10, concerning innovative schools funds, to limit the scope of the provisions to innovative schools operated by an IS operator.
