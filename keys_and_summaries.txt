Adds new requirement for all personal injury or wrongful death claims brought by a member or a member\\u2019s representative or estate against a third party to include a claim for all medical assistance payments for health care items or services furnished to the member as a result of the injury; deems such a claim that does not include the Plan\\u2019s claim to include the Plan\\u2019s claim.

Makes clarifying changes, specifying that the Plan has the right to first recovery over all nongovernmental liens and rights on any amounts recovered related to an injury caused by a liable third party, regardless of the timing of nongovernmental liens and rights in relation to the Plan\\u2019s liens and rights, who recovered the amount or how the amount was recovered. Allows the Plan to recover amounts the Plan is entitled to from the member, the member\\u2019s representative or estate, or the insurance company (previously, just the member) in the event the member or the member\\u2019s representative or estate (previously, just the member) recovers any amount from a liable third party.

Adds to the prohibition against a lien of the Plan exceeding 50% of the total damages recovered by the member, excluding from the calculation the member\\u2019s reasonable and proportionate costs of collection, conclusively determined by the Plan (previously, excluded the member\\u2019s reasonable costs of collection only). Adds new provisions providing for situations when governmental liens have priority over the Plan\\u2019s right to first recovery. Specifically prohibits the deduction of other liens from the Plan\\u2019s right to to recover under the statute. Adds that in the event insufficient funds remain to fully satisfy the Plan\\u2019s lien after deducting the member\\u2019s or member\\u2019s representative or estate\\u2019s costs of collection and any priority liens from the total damages recovered, the Plan is entitled to the remaining balance of the total damages recovered.\\nSection 7\\nEnacts GS 135-48.41(l), deeming the date of reemployment as the first hired date for purposes of Plan membership eligibility if an employee or retiree withdraws his or her accumulated contributions and then later is reemployed as an employee.
